### Steps:
#1. Write a program that asks the user "What is the capital of France?" and waits for their response.
#2. If the user's answer is correct (i.e., "Paris"), the program should print a message saying the answer is correct.
#3. If the answer is incorrect, the program should print a message saying the answer is wrong.
 
answer= input("what is the capital of france:")
if answer ==  "paris":                 #assigning the answer to given question.
   print ("answer is correct") 
else:                    
   print("the answer is incorrect")    # assigning to print ("the answer is incorrecct") if answer is not paris.
