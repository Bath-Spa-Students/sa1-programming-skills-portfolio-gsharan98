### Steps:
#1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
#2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
#3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
#4. Print the value of the sum to the console.

#simple sum
#assigning a number to first variable.
num_1 = 8

#assigning a number to second variable.
num_2 = 10

#putting both variables in third variable
total_num = (num_1 + num_2)

#printing third variable
print(total_num)
