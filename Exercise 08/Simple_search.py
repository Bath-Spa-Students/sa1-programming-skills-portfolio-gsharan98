### Optional Requirements:
#1. Allow the user to input the search term instead of using a predefined value.
#2. Implement the search functionality based on user input.
# list avaible searched items
listed_names = ["Jake", "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave"]

# asking user to input the name they want to search for, using .strip() to get rid of extra spaces
search_item = input("enter the the searched item: ").strip()


# Check if the entered name exists in the list, using a case-insensitive search
if search_item.lower() in [name.lower() for name in listed_names]:
   
   
    # if the searched item is  found, setting 'found' to True then we will let the user knoe
    print(f"wooh! '{search_item}' is  found in the list.")
else:
   
    
    # letting user know if loops complete and searched item is not found
    print(f"opps! '{search_item}' isn't  found in the list.")
